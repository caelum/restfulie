Restfulie
=========

This is a small cute plugin to show how to implement hypermedia based services in a easy way using rails.


Typical Restful Example
=======================

Trying to follow the definition of a restful application supporting resources with hypermedia content, a typical restful resource would be:

<pre>
<order>
	<product>basic rails course</product>
	<product>restful training</product>
	<atom:link rel="refresh" href="http://www.caelum.com.br/orders/1" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"/>
	<atom:link rel="update" href="http://www.caelum.com.br/orders/1" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"/>
	<atom:link rel="pay" href="http://www.caelum.com.br/orders/1" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"/>
	<atom:link rel="destroy" href="http://www.caelum.com.br/orders/1" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"/>
</order>
</pre>

Client Usage
============

One should first acquire the representation from the server through your common GET process and process it through the usual from_* methods:
<pre>
xml = Net::HTTP.get(URI.parse('http://www.caelum.com.br/orders/1'))
order = Order.from_xml(xml)
</pre>

And now you can invoke all those actions in order to change your resource's state:

<pre>
order.refresh
order.update
order.destroy
order.pay(payment)
</pre>

Note that:
1. refresh is get
2. update is put (and you have to put everything back)
3. destroy is delete
4. pay (unknown methods) is post

Resource format support
=======================

Restfulie currently supports xml+atom and will soon expand its support to xml+rel links and json+links supports. Those new formats will also support automatic http verb detection - if possible and reasonable.

How to customize your request
=============================

By default, restfulie uses the following table:

1. destroy, cancel and delete send a DELETE request
2. update sends a POST request
3. refresh, reload, show sends a GET request
4. other methods sends a POST request

If you want to use a custom http verb in order to send your request, you can do it by setting the optional string 'method':

<pre>
order.update(:method=>"post")
</pre>
