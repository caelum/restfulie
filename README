Restfulie
=========

This is a small cute plugin to show how to implement hypermedia based services in a easy way using rails.


Typical Restful Example
=======================

Trying to follow the definition of a restful application supporting resources with hypermedia content, a typical restful resource would be:

<pre>
<order>
	<product>basic rails course</product>
	<product>restful training</product>
	<atom:link rel="refresh" href="http://www.caelum.com.br/orders/1" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"/>
	<atom:link rel="update" href="http://www.caelum.com.br/orders/1" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"/>
	<atom:link rel="pay" href="http://www.caelum.com.br/orders/1" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"/>
	<atom:link rel="destroy" href="http://www.caelum.com.br/orders/1" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"/>
</order>
</pre> 

Client Usage
============

One should first acquire the representation from the server through your common GET process and process it through the usual from_* methods:
<pre>
xml = Net::HTTP.get(URI.parse('http://www.caelum.com.br/orders/1'))
order = Order.from_xml(xml)
</pre>

And now you can invoke all those actions in order to change your resource's state:

<pre>
order.refresh
order.update
order.pay(payment)
order.destroy
</pre>

Note that:
1. refresh is get
2. update is put (and you have to put everything back)
3. destroy is delete
4. pay (unknown methods) is post

If you want to customize your http request:

<pre>
order.pay(:form_data => {'from'=>'2005-01-01', 'to'=>'2005-03-31'}, ';') do |req|
	req.basic_auth 'jack', 'pass'
end
</pre>

Resource format support
=======================

Restfulie currently supports xml+atom and will soon expand its support to xml+rel links and json+links supports. Those new formats will also support automatic http verb detection - if possible and reasonable.
