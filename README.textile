h1. Quit pretending

CRUD through HTTP is a good step forward to using resources and becoming RESTFul, another step further into is to make use of hypermedia based services and this gem allows you to do it really fast.

h1. Restfulie: client-side

Here you can see how to access a resource and its services through the restfulie API:

<pre>
order = Order.from_web resource_uri      # retrieves order resource (xml/atom/json support)

puts "Order price is #{order.price}"

order.pay payment                        # sends a post request to pay this order

order.cancel                             # sends a delete request
</pre>

h1. Restfulie: server-side

This is a simple example how to make your state changes available to your resource consumers:

<pre>
	class Order < ActiveRecord::Base
	  def following_states
	    states = [ {:controller => :orders, :action => :show } ]
	    states << {:controller => :orders, :action => :destroy} if can_cancel?
	    states << {:controller => :orders, :action => :pay, :id => id} if can_pay?
	    states << {:controller => :payments, :action => :show, :payment_id => payment.id } if paied?
	    states
	  end
</pre>

h2. Installing

Just add in your environment.rb the following line:

<pre>
config.gem "restfulie", :source => "http://gemcutter.org"
</pre>

Execute: rake gems:install

or, if you prefer to install as a plugin:

script/plugin install git://github.com/caelum/restfulie.git

h2. Typical Restful Example

Trying to follow the definition of a restful application supporting resources with hypermedia content, a typical restful resource would be:

<pre>
<order>
	<product>basic rails course</product>
	<product>restful training</product>
	<atom:link rel="refresh" href="http://www.caelum.com.br/orders/1" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"/>
	<atom:link rel="update" href="http://www.caelum.com.br/orders/1" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"/>
	<atom:link rel="pay" href="http://www.caelum.com.br/orders/1" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"/>
	<atom:link rel="destroy" href="http://www.caelum.com.br/orders/1" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"/>
</order>
</pre>

h2. Client Usage

One should first acquire the representation from the server through your common GET process and process it through the usual from_* methods:
<pre>
xml = Net::HTTP.get(URI.parse('http://www.caelum.com.br/orders/1'))
order = Order.from_xml(xml)
</pre>

And now you can invoke all those actions in order to change your resource's state:

<pre>
order.refresh
order.update
order.destroy
order.pay(payment)
</pre>

Note that:
* refresh is get
* update is put (and you have to put everything back)
* destroy is delete
* pay (unknown methods) is post

h2. Resource format support

Restfulie currently supports xml+atom and will soon expand its support to xml+rel links and json+links supports. Those new formats will also support automatic http verb detection - if possible and reasonable.

h2. How to customize your request

By default, restfulie uses the following table:

* destroy, cancel and delete send a DELETE request
* update sends a POST request
* refresh, reload, show sends a GET request
* other methods sends a POST request

If you want to use a custom http verb in order to send your request, you can do it by setting the optional string 'method':

<pre>
order.update(:method=>"post")
</pre>
